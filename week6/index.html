    <h1>Week 6 Notes</h1>
    <p>Memoization
        Use this to cache results for bigger functions
        function square(x){
            square.cache = square.cache || {};
            if (!square.cache[x]) {
                square.cache[x] = x*x;
            }
            return square.cache[x]
        }
    </p>
    <p>IIFE's
        Anonymous founctions that is invoked as soon as it's defined.
        Helps keep from polluting var names
        Ex. -> 
        (function(){
            const temp = 'World';
            console.log(`Hello ${temp}`);
            })();
            << 'Hello World'
    </p>
    <p>
        Temp Variables
        That's right they are temporary variables that are not actually assigned to
        anything. 
        let a = 1;
let b = 2;
(()=>{
    const temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;
})();
a;
<< 2
b;
<< 1
console.log(temp);
<< Error: "temp is not defined"

Note that the temp only exists when IIFE is invoked.
    </p>

    <p>Initialization Code
        You don't always need to create reusable functions. Check this out ->
        (function() {
            const name = 'Peter Parker'; // This might be obtained from a cookie in reality
            const days = ['Sunday','Monday','Tuesday','Wednesday','Thursday', 'Friday','Saturday'];
            const date = new Date(),today = days[date.getDay()];
            console.log(`Welcome back ${name}. Today is ${today}`);
        })();
        << 'Welcome back Peter Parker. Today is Tuesday'
        You cant also write it like this.

        {
            const name = 'Peter Parker'; // This might be obtained from a cookie in reality
            const days = ['Sunday','Monday','Tuesday','Wednesday','Thursday', 'Friday','Saturday'];
            const date = new Date(),today = days[date.getDay()];
            console.log(`Welcome back ${name}. Today is ${today}`);
        }
        << 'Welcome back Peter Parker. Today is Tuesday'

    </p>

        <p>
            Better way to use Strict Mode

            (function() {
                'use strict';
            // All your code would go inside this function
            })();
        </p>

        <p>Self-Contained Code Blocks or Embedded Code
            You can also embed funcitons without naming them.
            (function() {
                // block A
                const name = 'Block A';
                console.log(`Hello from ${name}`);
                }());
                (function() {
                // block B
                const name = 'Block B';
                console.log(`Hello from ${name}`);
            }());
            <<  Hello from Block A
                Hello from Block B
        </p>

        <p>
            Functions that Return Functions
            This is the best example to explain this ->
            function greeter(greeting = 'Hello') {
                return function() {
                    console.log(greeting);
                }
            }
            const englishGreeter = greeter();
            englishGreeter();
            << Hello
            const frenchGreeter = greeter('Bonjour');
            frenchGreeter();
            << Bonjour
            const germanGreeter = greeter('Guten Tag');
            germanGreeter();
            << Guten Tag
        </p>

        <p>AJAX
            grabs data from the internet and adds it to our code.
            fetch('https://example.com/data')
.then( // code that handles the response )
.catch( // code that runs if the server returns an error )
