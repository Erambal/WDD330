    <h1>Week 5 Notes</h1>

    <p>Strict Mode
        Use this -> 'use strict' at the beginning of a JS file

        Here's what it will do.
        'use strict';
        e = 2.718;
        << ReferenceError: e is not defined 
        
        Aren't there extensions that do the same as 'use strict'?
    </p> 

    <p>Feature Detection

        To make sure that a method has browser support use ->
        if (window.holoDeck) {
            virtualReality.activate();
        }
        The example being used here is holoDeck.

        You can also use Modernizr and Can I Use?

    <p>Try, Catch, and finally 

        function imaginarySquareRoot(number) {
            'use strict';
            try {
                return String(squareRoot(number));
            } catch(error) {
                return squareRoot(-number)+'i';
            }
        }

        function imaginarySquareRoot(number) {
            'use strict';
            let answer;
            try {
                answer = String(squareRoot(number));
            } catch(error) {
                answer = squareRoot(-number)+"i";
            } finally {
                return `+ or - ${answer}`;
            }
        }
    </p>
        

    <p>Follow these steps

        Write tests (that initially fail)

        Write code to pass the tests

        Refactor the code

        Test refactored code

        Write more tests for new features
